Commit All The Things (CATT)
============================
CATT will jump into all subdirectories, run `git status`, add all changes to a commit if desired, and then pushes the commit to all remotes.

TL;DR
------
I'm lazy; I figure push out all the data and deal with it later

Version Notes
-------------
0.1.0 - First Commit(s)
0.2.0 - Now will Args! (more importantly ... an installer)
